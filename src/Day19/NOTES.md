# Notes

Definitely borrowed from this solution:
https://github.com/mstksg/advent-of-code-2020/blob/5065aad720f6996386e9c94fbd7904a6fa9f2d9d/reflections-out/day19.md

I struggled with the scenario where a string ends before the rules do. For the
life of me, I could not figure out how to get this working.

For example

```
Rules: H E L L O W O R L D
String: "HELLO"
```

I could get one or the other working, but never both.
